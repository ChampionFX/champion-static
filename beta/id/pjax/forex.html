                                        <p>Forex trading involves buying one currency and selling another currency at the same time. This is why you always see them quoted in pairs, such as EUR/USD or GBP/USD.</p>

                                        <p>Forex trading involves buying or selling currency pairs. When you buy a currency pair such as EUR/USD, it means that you are buying Euro and simultaneously selling the USD.</p>
                                        <p>Currency pairs are categorised in the following:</p>

                                            <li><h4>Exotic pairs</h4> - Consist of one major (non-USD) currency paired with the currency of an emerging economy. E.g. GBP/HKD.</li>
