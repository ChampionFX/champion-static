                                <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>
    <i>Version 1. Last modified 2017-01-06.</i>
</p>
<p>
    It is the responsibility of each Client to read and understand this legal notice and the terms and conditions pursuant to which an acquisition of financial contracts via this site is governed.
</p>
<h2>A. About Us and our Regulator</h2>
<p>The term "the Company" shall denote Champion Group Ltd., a company established in the Republic of Vanuatu under registration number 14772 and having its registered office at Govant Building, Port Vila, P.O. Box 1276, Vanuatu, Republic of Vanuatu. We are authorised by the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC) under the Dealers in Securities (Licensing) Act (Cap. 70) to carry on the business in dealing in securities.</p>
<h2>B. Introduction</h2>
<p>The financial trading services contained within this site are only suitable for Clients who are able to bear the loss of all the money they invest and who understand and have experience of the risks involved in the acquisition of financial contracts.</p>
<p>International currency, stock index, or commodity prices are highly volatile and very difficult to predict. Due to such volatility, plus the bias in the pricing system favouring the website (as described in more detail below), all contracts purchased in our system (whether or not the payout exceeds the premium amount) must be considered as carrying a high degree of risk.</p>
<p>The maximum loss that may be incurred by any Client is the amount of money paid by oneself to the Company.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right in its sole discretion to refuse and/or cancel services, charge deposit, and/or withdrawal fees to anyone for any reasons including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul class='bullet'>
    <li>any instance where the Company believes that person's activities at this site may be illegal in that person's country or state;</li>
    <li>any instance where the Company may be approached or contacted by legal authorities or regulators from that person's country or state;</li>
    <li>any instance where the Company may suffer any pecuniary, fiscal or regulatory disadvantage by virtue of that person's activities at this site;</li>
    <li>any restriction to its Clients from purchasing any contracts during certain hours.</li>
</ul>
<h2>C. Languages</h2>
<p>
    These Terms and Conditions, for the convenience of our Clients are provided in several different languages; however, these translations do reflect the same principles. We attempt, as much as possible to provide a faithful translation in English of the prevailing language. In the event of any differences between the English version of the website and any other language, the English version shall prevail.
</p>
<p>
    You may communicate with us through this website by means of Live Chat, email, or phone. Details can be found in the <a href="/beta/en/contact.html">Contact Us</a> page.
</p>
<p>
    Generally, we will communicate with you through this website or by email to the email address used when opening your Champion FX Real Account. We will communicate with you in English or, if you select another preferred language when opening your Champion FX Real Account, in that language.
</p>
<h2>D. Contracts</h2>
<p>
    The Company does not provide a market amongst, or between Clients for investments, securities, derivatives, or speculations. Each financial contract purchased by a Client via this site is an individual agreement between that Client and the Company and is not a security, nor is it transferable, negotiable or assignable to, or with any third party.
</p>
<p>
    Acquisition of financial contracts through this site must be effected in accordance with the terms and conditions presented on the pages of this site. Acquisition of a financial contract is completed when the financial contract has been customised, the premium (or the payout, as the case may be) has been calculated and payment has been verified.
</p>
<h2>E. Client's Liability</h2>
<p>
    Clients agree to be fully and personally liable for the due settlement of every transaction entered into under their Champion FX Real Account. This includes any transactions entered into by members of a Client's family or entourage who have gained access to the account. Clients are responsible for ensuring that they alone control access to the Champion FX Real Account, and that no minors are granted access to trading on the website. In any case, Clients remain fully liable for any, and all positions traded on their Champion FX Real Account, and for any credit card transactions entered into the site for their Champion FX Real Account. Each Client also indemnifies the Company in respect of all costs and losses of any kind, whatsoever as may be incurred by the Company as a result, direct or indirect, of the Client's failure to perform or settle such a transaction.
</p>
<h2>F. Customer Funds</h2>
<p>
    Money collected from Clients are not invested in any securities, futures, currencies, derivatives, or other investments, on behalf of Clients.
</p>
<p>
    The Company holds customer funds in separate bank accounts to the operational accounts; and arrangements have been made to ensure assets in the customer accounts are distributed to customers in the event of insolvency.
</p>
<p>
    The Company has various deposit methods available, each with their own timing for deposits, some of which might not be available for withdrawals. Full details of deposits and withdrawals methods available including settlement times are available <a class='pjaxload' href='/beta/en/cashier/payment-methods.html'>here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Your Champion FX Real Account should not be used as a banking facility and deposits should only be made with a view to using funds to place contracts. The Company is not a bank or a credit institution, Clients will not receive interest on deposits. Should you make repeated deposits and withdrawals without commensurate contracts being placed, we reserve the right to pass on to your Champion FX Real Account, without prior notice, any bank charges we have incurred before closing your Champion FX Real Account.
</p>
<h2>G. Prohibited Trades</h2>
<p>The Company reserves the right to refuse to do business with, to discontinue to do business with, and to reverse the transactions of, Clients who engage in any trading activity:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>that contravenes any laws, regulations, instruments, ordinances, or rules that govern the operation of any exchange, financial market, or financial regulatory environment; or</li>
    <li>with insider knowledge of any financial market or instrument.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company has the discretion to seek information from Clients to verify compliance with these terms.</p>
<p>It is a condition of using the website that:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>any Client that is employed in the banking and/or finance sector must only conduct trades through the website with the knowledge of his/her employer and in accordance with the employer’s policies; and that</li>
    <li>Clients agree to comply with the reasonable requests made by the Company for the purpose of verifying compliance with this term.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company may withhold payment of funds accumulated in a Client’s Champion FX Real Account while it takes steps to verify compliance with these terms.</p>
<p>If the Company (in its sole discretion) is not satisfied that a Client is complying with these terms, or if a Client does not comply with a reasonable request for information made by the Company, the Company may cancel the Client’s Champion FX Real Account and withhold any funds accumulated therein.</p>
<h2>H. Fraud and Money Laundering</h2>
<p>
    No person shall abuse this site for the purpose of money laundering. The Company employs best-practice anti-money laundering procedures. All transactions are checked to prevent money laundering which may have several effects on Clients. The Company reserves the right to refuse to do business with, to discontinue to do business with, and to reverse the transactions of, Clients who do not accept or adhere to these anti-money laundering processes. Acceptable funds should not originate from criminal activity. The Company is bound to report suspicious transactions to relevant authorities.
</p>
<p>The anti-money laundering processes have the following effects on Clients:</p>
<ul class='bullet'>
    <li>
        Clients must fill into the account opening form all requested details that establish their identity. Clients must give a true and valid photo identification, address, occupation, contact email and personal telephone number.
    </li>
    <li>
        Winnings may only be paid to the initiator of an account. When a Client maintains an account by means of telegraphic deposits, winnings are only paid to the holder of the originating bank account, and it is the onus of the Client to ensure that account number and name accompany all transfers to the Company. When a Client maintains an account by means of credit/debit card deposits, winnings are only paid back to the same card.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clients must register personally.
    <li>
        Clients shall not hold or pool third party funds into their own Champion FX Real Account held with the Company.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is prohibited to sell, transfer, and/or acquire accounts to/from other Clients. Transfer of funds among other Clients is also prohibited.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only one Champion FX Real Account is allowed per person. No winnings and/or refunds may be collected on accounts opened in false names or on multiple accounts opened by the same person.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Company may, from time to time, at its sole discretion, or as required by regulations in place, conduct appropriate "Know Your Customer" procedures and require a Client to provide proof of identity (such as notarised copy of passport or other means of identity verification as the Company deems required under the circumstances) and may at its sole discretion suspend an account until satisfactory identification information, evidence of identity and address, source of funds, and/or source of wealth have been provided. “Know Your Customer” documentation will be required when a Client opens a Champion FX Real Account with the Company.
    </li>
    <li>
        You agree that we may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud checks. Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Telephone conversations may be recorded and/or monitored by designated staff for quality and anti-fraud purposes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>I. Company's Right</h2>
<p>The Company reserves the right to suspend the operation of this site or sections thereof:</p>
<ul class='bullet'>
    <li>
        When, as a result of political, economic, military or monetary events (including unusual market volatility or illiquidity) or any circumstances outside the control, responsibility, and power of the Company, the continued operation of this site is not reasonably practicable without materially and adversely affecting and prejudicing the interests of Clients or the Company, or if, in the opinion of the Company, a price cannot be calculated for financial contracts.
    </li>
    <li>
        When there is a breakdown in the means of communication normally employed in determining the price or value of any of the financial contracts or where the price or value of any of the financial contracts cannot be promptly or accurately ascertained.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Company has and retains the right, to terminate any event or trade, including, but not limited to, the occurrence of any of the above events.
    </li>
    <li>
        In any event of an error in current prices, published odds, or trading software.
    </li>
    <li>
        In all circumstances, the Company reserves the right to make changes to these Terms and Conditions. If the Company elects to make any material changes to these Terms and Conditions, our Clients will be notified in advance and shall either accept or decline to agree. Declining to agree shall result in a material breach of this agreement and the Client's Champion FX Real Account may be frozen, suspended or cancelled.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In such an event, the Company may at its sole discretion (with or without notice) close out a Client's open financial contracts at prices it considers fair and reasonable at such a time and no claims may be entertained against the Company in connection thereto.</p>
<p>Further, the Company, under the above circumstances, or any other, reserves the right to adjust a Client's Champion FX Real Account should any trade result in a disruption, miscarry or aborted trade.</p>
<p>Although the Company has, and retains all rights to refuse or to close a Client's Champion FX Real Account, the Company does warrant that all contractual obligations already made, shall be honoured.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to cancel/reverse transactions or amend the contractual terms (including, but not limited to, entry and exit spot) in the case that any contracts are acquired or sold at prices that do not reflect fair market prices, or that are acquired or sold at an abnormally low level of risk due to an undetected programming error, bug, or glitch in our website software, market data feed or contract pricing latency, data feed error, stray quotes, incorrect pricing parameters, or manifest mis-calculation of prices or other obvious errors ("Manifest Errors"). Clients have a duty to report to the Company any such problems, errors, or suspected system inadequacies that they may experience and may not abuse of, or arbitrage such system problems or errors for profit.

<h2>M. Account Opening</h2>

<ul class="bullet">
    <li>you have read this Legal Terms and Conditions page in full and understood that you will be buying and selling financial contracts subject to these terms and conditions;</li>
    <li>you have read our privacy statement and hereby give us consent to process your personal information as outlined there;</li>
    <li>you are over 18 years of age;</li>
    <li>you are not resident in a restricted country such as Bosnia and Herzegovina; Costa Rica; Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Ethiopia, any European Union country; Guyana; Hong Kong; Iran; Iraq; Jersey; Malaysia; Syria; Uganda; the United Kingdom; USA; Vanuatu; Yemen; and any such other restricted country as the Company may decide from time to time at its sole discretion;</li>
    <li>you have sufficient experience and knowledge in matters of financial trading to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of acquiring financial contracts via this site and have done so without relying on any information contained in this site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>N. Account Closure</h2>
<p>You may choose to contact us to close your Champion FX Real Account held with the Company. Your Champion FX Real Account may be closed if you do not have any open trade positions and if you have complied with the requested "Know Your Client" procedures to enable you to withdraw any pending funds in your Champion FX Real Account.</p>
<h2>O. Trading Rules</h2>
<p>The Company may impose certain rules and restrictions in relation to the placing of market orders on this website. Such rules may change from time to time, according to market conditions and other factors. The following indicative rules are currently in place:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>Contracts will not usually be offered at odds under 0.05-to-1 (i.e., payouts of under USD 1.05 for each USD 1 staked).</li>
    <li>Contracts are not usually offered in the last hour of trade of any given market (for foreign exchange markets, the restriction may be extended up to 3 hours).</li>
    <li>Contracts will not usually be offered when the underlying market is at its intraday high or intraday low.</li>
    <li>Contracts on certain markets will not be offered during the first 10 minutes of the trading day.</li>
    <li>During fast markets (i.e. periods of very fast market movements), contracts may be offered at prices more unfavourable than those offered in usual market conditions.</li>
    <li>Certain limits are imposed as to the acceptable levels for barrier/strike prices of contracts. Typically, the barrier/strike may not be too close nor too far from the current underlying market level.</li>
    <li>Contracts may not expire on a weekend; therefore the expiry date of a contract may be pushed forward to the following Monday in the event of a contract expiry date falling on a Saturday or a Sunday.</li>
    <li>Market prices are updated at most once per second. For any given second, the market price will be updated to the first tick, if any, received in that particular second on the company data feed.</li>
    <li>The Company does not guarantee the ability to sell a contract prior to its expiration time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>P. Contract Payouts</h2>
<p>Contract payouts shall be determined by the Company by reference to the daily high/low/close values reported on this website relevant to the underlying index(ices) of the contract(s), or from the interbank trading data received by the Company for Forex quotes or commodities prices as displayed on the website, subject that the Company shall have the right to make corrections to such data in the event of mis-priced or typographically incorrect data. Clients should note that the different markets may close at different times during the day due to local trading hours and time zones.</p>
<p>In the case of single stock and stock index prices, the final closing price as reported by the relevant official exchange shall apply for all settlements (this final settlement price may, at times, be reported by the relevant exchange 30-90 minutes after the official closing time of the market, and may differ from the latest tick price that occurred at the closing time).</p>
<p>For Forex quotes, the closing times are defined by the Company as shown in the <a href="/beta/en/trading-times.html">Trading Times</a> section of the website. In the event of any dispute regarding market or settlement values, the decision of the Company shall be final and binding. Clients should note that certain markets (such as stocks and stock indices) are not open throughout the day and that trading may not be available when the markets are closed.</p>
<p>The calculation of the price to be paid (or the payout to be received) for financial contracts on this site at the time the financial contract is purchased or sold will be based on the Company's best estimate of market price movements and the expected level of interest rates, implied volatilities and other market conditions during the life of the financial contract, and is based on complex mathematics. The calculation will include a bias in favour of the Company. The financial contract prices (or the payout amounts) offered to Clients speculating on market or index prices may differ substantially from prices available in the primary markets where stock indices or commodities or contracts thereupon are traded, due to the bias favouring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above.</p>
<p>The charting data made available to Clients by the Company is indicative only and may, at times, differ from the real market values. The Company's decision as to the calculation of a financial contract price will be final and binding. The Company allows the option to sell contracts before expiry time of some contracts but will not be obliged to do so and can suspend this option depending on the current market conditions. Contracts may be amended when the underlying asset value is adjusted by corporate actions during the contract period.</p>
<p>Should a disruption occur in the data feeds which cannot be readily rectified by the Company, the Company reserves the right to refund the contract purchase.</p>
<h2>Q. Trading Limits</h2>
<p>The Company may impose volume trading limits on your Champion FX Real Account at its sole discretion.</p>

<p>Clients registered with Champion Group Ltd can raise their unresolved disputes with management by submitting an email to complaints@champion-fx.com.</p>
<h2>S. Conflicts Policy</h2>
<p>We provide here a summary of the policy we maintain in order to manage conflicts of interest in respect of the duties we owe to our Clients.</p>
<ol>
    <li>General
        <p>It is understood that Champion Group Ltd, as a counterparty, has an interest, relationship, or arrangement that is material in relation to any trade effected on behalf of you, and it is agreed that any company so interested shall be entitled to retain any benefit or profit received, and shall not be liable to account therefore to you by reason only of such conflict.</p>
        <p>We aim to establish, maintain, and operate effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all reasonable steps to prevent conflicts of interest from constituting or giving rise to a material risk of damage to the interests of our Clients.</p>
        <p>We have in place adequate internal procedures to ensure that you are in all cases treated fairly and that the risk of damage to Client interests will be mitigated.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Our Policy
        <p>We aim to keep a record of the kinds of activity we carry on in which a material conflict could arise or has arisen. We also maintain procedures to manage actual or potential conflicts. This includes procedures to maintain appropriate independence between members of our staff who are involved in potentially conflicting activities, for example, through the operation of information barriers, physical separation of staff, the segregation of duties and responsibilities and maintenance of a policy of independence which requires our staff, when providing services to a Client, to act in the best interests of the Client and to disregard any conflicts of interest; and, in some circumstances declining to act for a Client or potential Client.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Disclosure: general
        <p>Where our arrangements to manage conflicts are not or cannot be sufficient to be reasonably confident that risks of damage to a Client's interest will be prevented, we aim to disclose the general nature or sources of conflicts. This is aimed at allowing the Client the opportunity to consider whether to ask for more information by sending an email to compliance@champion-fx.com, or to continue with the service; we do not aim to provide detailed, highly specific, or comprehensive information.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>T. Data Feed</h2>
<p>Information about the data feeds used by the Company, and how the data is processed before being fed into the system.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Filtering Stray Ticks
        <p>Depending on the quality of the data feeds received from our feed providers, our servers might apply a tick filtering algorithm. The purpose of this filtering algorithm is to strip the feed of stray ticks. Stray ticks are ticks that manifestly fall outside of the current trading range of the market; such ticks are often due to communication delays with the exchanges or banks that provide quotes, human error, or database problems at any point between the originator of the quote and our servers.</p>
        <p>The filtering algorithm may, for example, be similar to the "Bollinger Bands" volatility system –– i.e., short-term volatility bands are determined around the present market value, and ticks that are manifestly outside of such bands are removed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Smoothing out random noise
        <p>Depending on the quality of the feeds received from our feed providers, our servers might also apply a very short-term smoothing algorithm to the data feed. This smoothing algorithm removes a little of the "random noise" surrounding the data feed, and ensures that clients who buy path- dependent contracts (such as the one-touch or barrier-range contracts) will not have their contracts knocked-in or knocked-out by random short-term market noise that does not reflect the true market price.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Differences with other data feeds
        <p>Our data feed may at times differ slightly from other data feeds found on the internet (who may themselves differ between each other). Reasons for differences in feed providers include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>For Forex: The Forex market is an OTC (over- the- counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no 'official' price source for Forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different subset of international banks. Accordingly, prices may differ between providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.</li>
            <li>The smoothing and filtering algorithms described above.</li>
            <li>Market-closing times: Please refer to the <a href="/beta/en/trading-times.html">Trading Times</a> page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example, some websites choose 4 o'clock NY time, or 5 o'clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low, and closing prices displayed on our website may differ to those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.</li>
            <li>Use of bid/ask prices: when the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. Our system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, our website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Our data feed is designed to be one of the best and most robust available for a trading environment.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Weekend quotes
        <p>Please note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of contract settlement. During weekends, the Forex markets may occasionally generate prices. However, these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push prices up or down). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is the Company’s policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

                <li>We reasonably consider that funds may be required to meet any Margin Requirement; and/or</li>
                <li>There is any amount outstanding from you to us; and/or</li>
                <li>We are required to do so in accordance with any relevant law or regulation.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Withdrawal of funds from your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account must be made in the same currency maintained in your Champion FX Real Account.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Negative Balance Protection</li>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The Company has a Stop Out policy which prevents you from losing more than you have deposited. However, in the event that your Open Positions are not closed when the Margin Level for your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account reaches the Stop Out Level, the Company, at its sole discretion, may waive your negative balance by crediting your account if your Account Balance goes into a negative balance. The negative balance is determined by aggregating all the client’s negative balances incurred over a 24-hour period across all accounts held by you. You acknowledge that the offer of the Negative Balance Protection by the Company to you is at the Company’s sole discretion and we reserve the right to change the features and eligibility criteria of the Negative Balance Protection at any time. The provisions of the Negative Balance Protection do not apply:
            <ol>
                <li>in the case of a force majeure event;</li>
                <li>in abnormal market conditions or exceptional market movements/volatility;</li>
                <li>in the case of a client opening any Transaction in relation to Prohibited Trades;</li>
                <li>in the case of Professional Clients;</li>
                <li>where the negative balance is connected to or a result of functional limitations and/or malfunction of the MT5 Trading Platform; and</li>
                <li>in the case of a client breaching any of the terms of this Agreement which results in a negative balance.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The Company does not offer any credit facilities or arrangement to its clients in normal trading circumstances. You acknowledge and agree that you will not be dealing with us on credit, regardless of the amount of your Account Balance and Transactions entered into with us.</li>
        <li>If your account is not subject to the Negative Balance Protection, you are required to settle the full amount immediately by making a payment to us.</li>
        <li>If you fail to immediately make a full settlement of the sum due to us in accordance with this Agreement, we reserve the right to accrue interest on the sums due from you to us in respect of any Transaction that you fail to pay on the relevant due date. Interest will accrue on a daily basis from the relevant due date until the date on which payment is received in full at the bank's official base rate for short term funds determined by us, and will be payable on demand.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Inactive/Dormant Accounts</li>
    <ol>
        <li>We reserve the right to charge a dormant fee of up to USD/EUR/AUD/GBP 25 every six months for every Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account that has had no transaction recorded for a period of 12 consecutive months or more.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Account Security</li>
    <ol>
        <li>We are committed to making sure that your personal data and transactions are secure:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account password and login ID are unique and passwords are hashed so that not even Champion-FX.com staff can read them. This is the reason why we cannot retrieve your password and have to issue you with a new one to your email address if you cannot recall it;</li>
            <li>It is your responsibility to keep your password and login ID confidential. You agree that you will not disclose your password and login ID to any other person;</li>
            <li>All credit card details are submitted directly to the Visa/Mastercard network using the latest SSL encryption technology, in accordance with bank policies;</li>
            <li>Our information security policies are based on industry best practices in access control and business continuity; and</li>
            <li>We use identity verification services and real-time fraud detection measures to help protect you from unauthorised access to your account. We also monitor account activity for signs of unusual activity that might indicate fraud and work with collection agencies and law enforcement agencies to address fraud issues.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Closing an account</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If you wish to withdraw funds from your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account and close your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account, you may notify us by contacting our helpdesk at <a href='mailto:support@champion-fx.com'>support@champion-fx.com</a>. Your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account may be closed if you do not have any Open Positions and all amounts due to us have been settled.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Swap-free Account</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Upon your request and consent, we may convert your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to a Swap-free Account. You acknowledge that we reserve the right to request justifications, documents, and/or additional information in relation to your conversion request prior to the conversion. You also acknowledge that all open positions under the Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to be converted to a Swap-free Account must be closed prior to you accessing the Swap-free Account. We may, acting reasonably, accept or reject your conversion request at our sole discretion for any reason whatsoever without being obliged to provide any explanation or justifications.</li>
        <li>Upon converting the Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to a Swap-free Account, you acknowledge and agree that no interest adjustment (or swap rate adjustment) will be made to your Swap-free Account when rolling over your Open Positions. This means that we will not debit interest (interest charge to you) of any form in respect of your Swap-free Account; likewise, by requesting and consenting the conversion to a Swap-free Account, you acknowledge and agree that you are waiving your entitlement to receive interest in respect of your Swap-free Account. This means that we will not credit interest (interest income to you) of any form in respect of your Swap-free Account.</li>
        <li>We will take all reasonable steps to provide you with the features and facilities of a Swap-free Account. The interest-free arrangements in place in relation to your Swap-free Account does not warranty or represent (whether express or implied) that your Swap-free Account is Sharia-compliant. You agree and acknowledge that the execution, delivery and performance of your Swap-free Account is in accordance with the terms, characteristics and features as determined by us and may not conform with your corresponding Sharia principles and requirements.</li>
        <li>
            The provision of Swap-free Accounts by us to you is made in good faith. By requesting and consenting to convert your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to a Swap-free Account, you represent and warrant to us that you will not take any unfair advantage of its terms or to enter into Transactions that take advantage of the differences between Swap-free Accounts and non-swap-free Accounts (which can be a Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account). In the event that we detect any form of abuse, fraud, manipulation, or any other forms of deceitful activity in regards to your Swap-free Account, we may, at our absolute discretion:
            <ol>
                <li>revoke the Swap-free status and convert your Swap-free Account to a non-Swap-free Account;</li>
                <li>treat all your Transactions closed under your Swap-free Account as void and nullify all profits generated or losses incurred in relation to your Swap-free Account; and</li>
                <li>adjust (either by debiting or crediting your account) any un-accrued interest charges (due from you to us) or income (due from us to you) in relation to your Swap-free Account.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

<h2>F. Orders</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Order Execution/Cancellation/Modification</li>
    <ol>
        <li>You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to understand the features, characteristics, terms, and conditions of an Order and the implications of executing an Order before you place an Order with us.</li>
        <li>Subject to network latency, we endeavour to execute your Order within a reasonable time from the time you triggered the Order, at the Price nearest to your specified Price. We do not guarantee that a Transaction will be opened/closed following an Order being triggered by you at your specified Price, stop level, or limit order level.</li>
        <li>We endeavour to open or close the Transaction to which your Order relates at the price reasonably available to us, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution. Best execution means that we must take all sufficient steps to obtain, when executing orders, the best possible result for you, taking into account the price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature, or any other consideration relevant to the execution of the order.</li>
        <li>Our Prices are determined by reference to the price of the underlying instrument which is quoted on external exchanges or dealing facilities that we select at our discretion. Our IT infrastructure and price aggregator system facilitates the reception of quotes from shortlisted prime brokers who act as liquidity providers for us and the delivery of the quotes, derived with reference against relevant benchmark and markets, to you. You acknowledge that our Prices may differ from the bid and offer prices made available by external exchanges or dealing facilities and we are not liable for any losses that you incur arising from such differences.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Order Types</li>
    <ol>
        <li>We may, at our absolute discretion, accept an Order from you. Example of Orders offered currently:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Market Orders &ndash; Market orders are instructions to deal now in your specified volume at spot price. When you execute a market order, your market order transaction becomes and Open Position which is subject to market fluctuations that occur between the time your market order is received/executed and the time your market order is filled. This means that your market order will be filled at the first available price that may be different from the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your market order on the electronic trading platform. By placing a Market order with us, you acknowledge that you are placing an instruction to open/close a Transaction regardless of the bid/offer price.</li>
            <li>Pending Orders &ndash; Pending orders are instructions to deal when your pre-defined conditions, for example, bid/offer price, are fulfilled. Pending orders are filled at the first available price which may be the same as the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your market order on the electronic trading platform, or a few pips away due to slippage. You acknowledge that your pending order is triggered only if your pre-defined conditions attached to your pending order are fulfilled. This means that your pending order will not be filled if your pre-defined conditions attached to your pending orders are not fulfilled and you can skip a Transaction entirely. You can change your pre-defined conditions any time before your pending orders are filled.</li>
            <li>Stop Orders &ndash; Stop orders are instructions to deal by opening or closing a Transaction when our quote reaches a level that is less favourable to you when compared against the current market price. By placing a stop order, you acknowledge that you are specifying a stop level and your stop order will be triggered if our bid/offer price moves against your favour to a point that it at or beyond your specified stop level. There are two types of stop order, stop closing order and stop entry order. A stop closing order is used to automatically close and Open Position when the market price reaches your specified stop level to limit your downside risk (a loss to you). A stop entry order is used to automatically open a position when the market price reaches your specified stop level to increase the probability of a profit to you.</li>
            <li>Limit Orders &ndash; Limit orders operate on a rationale that is the opposite of stop orders. Limit orders are instructions to deal by opening or closing a Transaction when our quote reaches a level that is more favourable to you when compared against the current market price. By placing a limit order, you acknowledge that you are specifying a limit and your limit order will be triggered if our bid/offer price moves in your favour to a point that it at or beyond your specified limit. The limit order level is the maximum offer price at which you are willing to place an order to buy or the minimum at which you are willing to place an order to sell. </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Whilst we endeavour to explain how an Order operates through the content on Champion-FX.com, you acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to understand how an Order operates on the MT5 trading platform prior to placing any such Order with us.</li>
        <li>You may specify your instruction of a Stop Order or a Limit Order may be applied for a limited duration or for an indefinite period (a "good till cancelled" or "GTC" Order).</li>
        <li>In the case of a Stop Order, you acknowledge that we will endeavour to open/close a Transaction at the First Available Price.</li>
        <li>In the case of a Limit Order, you acknowledge that we will endeavour to open/close a Transaction at a level that is the same or better than the limit order level you specified, subject to the availability of the Limit Price. You acknowledge that at the time of order execution, our bid/offer price may become less favourable to you.</li>
        <li>You may not cancel or amend the level of your Stop and Limit Order prior to the closing of your Transaction once the level has been reached.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that a Stop or Limit Order placed on your Open Position, when executed, would be capable of closing or partly closing your Transaction. You also acknowledge that it is your responsibility to cancel the Stop or Limit Order that you placed on your Open Positions if you do not want the Stop or Limit Order to remain valid. If you close your original Transaction and fail to cancel the Stop or Limit Order, we shall be entitled, at our absolute discretion, to treat the Stop or Limit Order as an instruction to enter into a new Transaction for you if and when our quote reaches or goes beyond the level of the Stop or Limit Order.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that we reserve the right to establish a minimum and maximum transaction size which may be subject to alteration and that we will only execute Orders that fall within the range of the minimum and maximum transaction size.</li>
        <li>When Gapping occurs, we will seek to open or close the Transaction to which your Order relates, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution. You acknowledge that when Gapping occurs in the underlying instrument on which your margin trading product is based, the time and level (the bid/offer price) at which your accepted order will be executed may have a regard to the volume of your Order, the liquidity and volatility of the market of the underlying instrument on which your margin trading product is based, the sequence of your Order, and possible network latency. We will endeavour to fill/partially fill your Order within a reasonable time at the First Available Price after the gap has been filled.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that you will factor the following liquidity risks into any of your trading decision on Champion-FX.com during low liquidity levels of the market of the underlying instrument on which your margin trading product is based:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Difficulty to open or close a Transaction at the level (the bid/offer price) you requested;</li>
            <li>Delays in execution while a counterparty for your Transaction is identified;</li>
            <li>Differences in the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your order on the electronic trading platform and when your order is filled; and</li>
            <li>Wider bid-offer spread due to the decrease in the probability that the highest price any buyer is prepared to pay and the lowest price any seller is happy to accept will move closer together.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You acknowledge that during low liquidity levels, your orders may be filled at the First Available Price which may be the same as the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your market order on the electronic trading platform, or a few pips away due to slippage.</p>
        <li>We may, at our absolute discretion, disregard your Order if a force majeure event takes place resulting in it no longer being reasonable for us to act on your Order after indicating an acceptance of your Order.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>

<h2>G. Margin</h2>
<ol>
    <li>General Provisions</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Prior to placing an Order which results in opening a Transaction or increasing an existing Open Position, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure that your account&rsquo;s Free Margin is sufficient to cover the Margin required in relation to the open Transaction (the "Margin Requirement"), and to continuously meet the Margin Requirement.</li>
        <li>Throughout the duration of the Transaction and for as long as the Transaction is open, you are required to maintain a sufficient Account Equity to cover any Margin Requirement. If your Account Equity is less than the Margin Requirement in relation to the open Transaction you wish to create, you have entered into a Margin Call and you are required to fund the shortfall immediately. You may not be able to place an Order to open a Transaction until the shortfall has been funded and there is sufficient Account Equity to cover the Total Margin.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to monitor your Account Balance and Margin Requirement and we are not under any obligation to keep you informed (i.e., to make a Margin Call).</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Margin Requirement and Calculation</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The Margin Requirement is a percentage of the value of the Open Positions and will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the value of the Open Positions throughout the duration of the relevant contracts (the "Contract Value").</li>
        <li>Margin Requirements can increase/decrease based on the aggregated size of your Open Position determined by the volume (number of lots), contract size (value per point in the original currency of the contract), market price, and margin rate.</li>
        <li>We may modify Margin Requirements for any Open Positions or new Transactions entered into, at our sole discretion. Formulas for Margin Requirements published on the website are indicative only and may be changed by the Company at its discretion at any time, due to changing market conditions or other factors.</li>
        <li>Whilst we endeavour to close out your Open Positions if and when the Margin Level for your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, we do not guarantee that your Open Positions will be closed when the Margin Level for your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account reaches the Stop Out Level.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Stop Out Level</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If the Margin Level for your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, this will be classified as an Event of Default. In such circumstances, Open Positions are automatically closed in the following order: (i) the server analyses clients' Orders that are not under execution at the moment; (ii) the server deletes Orders with the largest Margin; (iii) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the next order is deleted (orders without margin requirements are not deleted); (iv) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the server closes a position with the largest loss; (v) Open Positions are closed until your Margin Level becomes higher than the Stop Out Level.</li>
        <li>The default Stop Out Level applicable to your Account is published on our website. However, the default Stop Out Level is subject to alteration at our absolute discretion. Any changes to the Stop Out Level will take effect immediately. We will endeavour to notify you of an alteration to the default Stop Out Level by publishing the revised default Stop Out Level on our website. It is your responsibility to check our website regularly and remain informed about the default Stop Out Level.</li>
        <li>The Stop Out Level applicable to your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account may differ from the default Stop Out Level published on our website.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Margin Payment</li>
    <ol>
        <li>You may make Margin Payments by transferring funds from your Champion FX Real Account to your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account. In the event that there are insufficient funds in your Champion FX Real Account to fund your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account, you may make Margin Payments by funding your Champion FX Real Account and transferring the funds from your Champion FX Real Account to your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account.</li>
        <li>Margin Payments are due immediately and shall be received in full by us.</li>
    </ol>

At any point in time, we may be entering into or may have entered into transactions with a large number of clients, each of whose interests may diverge from those of other clients. As such, the Company may be holding Open Positions that may not be aligned with your objectives/interests as an individual client of the Company.</li>

</ol>

<h2>J. Trading Transactions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Opening a Transaction</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A Transaction is opened by either executing a "Buy" or "Sell" Order based on a specified number of lots (volume) that constitute the underlying instrument of the relevant market.</li>
        <li>Any Transaction opened by you must be within any credit or position limit in effect with respect to the Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account or any Transactions.</li>
        <li>Upon opening a Transaction, the sum due and payable by you to us is deducted from your Account Balance.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Closing a Transaction</li>
    <ol>
        <li>General Provisions</li>
        <ol>
            <li>An Open Position may be closed by placing an opposite Order, that is an Order to sell (to close a Long Position) or to buy (to close a Short Position) in the same market for the same specified number of lots (volume).</li>
            <li>An Open Position may be partially closed by entering into an opposite Transaction in the same Market but for a smaller number of lots (volume) as the Open Position.</li>
            <li>If a closing Transaction in the same market is entered into but with a higher number of lots, the original Open Position will be closed and a new Open Position will be entered into for the number of lots by which the new Transaction exceeds the Open Position.</li>
            <li>If you have entered into more than one Open Position in the same market, any closing Transaction that you place in the same market will close the Open Positions in the chronological order in which the Open Positions were first created on a first in, first out basis.</li>
            <li>Upon closing a Transaction, the realised profit (or loss), which is represented by the difference between the opening level and closing level of the Transaction multiplied by the number of lots (volume), becomes due and payable by us to you (or due and payable by you to us in cases of realised loss).</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Trading Rules</li>

<h2>L. Event of Default</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Each of the following event constitutes an "Event of Default":</li>

            <li>Suspending your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account and refusing to execute any Orders to enter into further Transactions with you.

        </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>In the event of your failing to make a Margin Payment, we may, at our absolute discretion, allow your Open Positions to remain open and allow you to place new Orders to open a Transaction.

<h2>M. Manifest Error</h2>
<ol>
    <li>We reserve the right to void or amend the contractual terms of any Transactions that we reasonably believe are entered into at prices that do not reflect fair market prices or that are entered into at an abnormally low level of risk due to an obvious or palpable error (a &ldquo;Manifest Error&rdquo;). In deciding whether an error is a Manifest Error, we may take into account any relevant information, including the state of the underlying market at the time of the error and any error within, or lack of clarity of, any information source or pronouncement. You have a duty to report to us any such problems, errors, or suspected system inadequacies that you may experience and may not abuse or arbitrage such system problems or errors for profit. We will endeavour to resolve any such difficulties in the shortest time possible.</li>
    <li>Any amendments to the contractual terms of Manifestly Erroneous contracts shall be reasonable and fair. Monies exchanged between you and us in connection with the Manifestly Erroneous contracts shall be returned to the recipient according to the amendments made to the contractual terms and conditions of this Agreement.</li>

                                <h2>Risk Disclosure Statement</h2>

It is important that you fully understand the risks involved before making a decision to enter into, or sell an investment product with us. If you are in any doubt about the risks involved with the Investment Products, you should seek professional advice.</p>
<p>If you choose to enter into a Contract with us, it is important that you remain aware of the risks involved, that you have adequate investment resources to bear such risks and that you monitor your positions carefully.</p>
<h2>General Risks</h2>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>No Advice
        <p>Our services are provided on an execution-only basis. We do not provide investment advice in relation to our products or services. We sometimes provide factual information or research recommendations about a market, information about transaction procedures and information about the potential risks involved and how those risks may be minimised. However, any decision to use our products or services is made by you.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for managing your tax and legal affairs including making any regulatory filings and payments and complying with applicable laws and regulations. We do not provide any regulatory, tax, or legal advice. If you are in any doubt as to the tax treatment or liabilities of Investment Products available through Champion-FX.com, you may wish to seek independent advice.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Appropriateness
        <p>Before we open an account for you to trade or invest in Investment Products with Champion-FX.com, we are required to make an assessment of whether the Investment Products or services you have chosen are appropriate for you, and to warn you if, on the basis of the information you provide to us, any such product or service is not appropriate.

    </li>

        <p>It is important that you monitor all of your positions closely. It is your responsibility to monitor your positions and during the period that you have any open Contracts, you should always have the ability to access your Accounts.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Contract Risks</h2>
<p>You should not trade or invest in Binary Options unless you know and understand the features risks involved and you may lose all the money invested.</p>
<p>"Binary" or "digital" options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Binary Option expires. Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple "Yes or No" approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option.</p>
<p>Trading in Binary Options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk that can result in the loss of your entire investment. Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved in such transactions. You should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for you in light of your investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. You should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless you understand the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If you are in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for you, please seek independent advice from an investment consulting professional.</p>
<p>Champion-FX.com does not provide such advice. It is your responsibility, taking into account your personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with Champion-FX.com, as well as prior to making any individual order. Where you do not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with Champion-FX.com or in making any individual order, you should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If you continue to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, you should not trade at all.</p>
<p>You are advised that the Binary Options offered by Champion-FX.com are not traded under the rules of any recognised, designated or regulated exchange. Consequently, engaging in Binary Options trading may expose you to substantially greater risks than investments which are so traded.</p>
<p>You are warned of the following additional risks:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>Derivative investment instruments such as Binary Options and related markets can be highly volatile. The prices of the underlying instrument which a Binary Option refers to may fluctuate rapidly and over wide ranges and may reflect unforeseeable events or changes in conditions, none of which can be controlled by you or Champion-FX.com.</li>
    <li>Champion-FX.com makes efforts that the quoted prices of each underlying asset that a Binary Option refers to will be reasonably related to the actual prices of such asset available in the market. Champion-FX.com makes no warranty, expressed or implied, that the quoted prices represent prevailing market prices.</li>
    <li>Champion-FX.com may have access to information that is not available to you, may have acquired trading positions at prices that are not available to you, and may have interests different from your interests. Champion-FX.com does not undertake any obligation to provide you with market or other information we possess, nor to alter or refrain from our own trading.</li>
    <li>Information of the previous performance of any underlying instrument or asset does not guarantee its current and/or future performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks of Investment Products</h2>
<p>Investing or trading in Contracts exposes you to the performance of the underlying or reference instrument or asset to which the Binary Contract refers including foreign exchange, indices, stocks, and commodities each of which have their own features and risks.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Risk: Exchange rates between foreign currencies can change rapidly due to a wide range of economic, political, and other conditions, exposing you to risk of exchange rate losses in addition to the inherent risk of loss from trading the underlying investment product. If you deposit funds in a currency to trade Contracts denominated in a different currency, your gains or losses on the underlying investment therefore may be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the currencies.</p>
<p>Other Risks: There are other risks that relate to trading investment products and trading foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, securities, options and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if economic or political or other unforeseen events locally or overseas affect the market. In addition to these types of risk, there may be other factors such as accounting and tax treatment issues that you should consider.</p>

Champion-FX.com will not accept liability for any loss or damage, including but without limitation to, any loss of profit that may arise directly or indirectly from the use of, or reliance on such information.</p>
<h2>Internet Trading Risks</h2>
<p>There are risks associated with utilising an internet-based deal execution trading system, including but not limited to the failure of hardware, software and internet connection.

                                <h2>Risk Disclosure Statement</h2>
<p>This Risk Disclosure Statement is not exhaustive and is not intended to constitute a comprehensive statement of all the risks which you might be exposed to and does not describe all risks inherent to forex and contracts for difference that exist now or which may arise in the future. Its objective is rather to provide you with information to reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for difference offered by Champion-FX.com, in our interest and aim to provide you with the best possible trading experience.</p>

<h2>Forex and contracts for difference are high risk and speculative</h2>
<p>Forex and contracts for difference transactions involve a high degree of risk and are speculative because they allow you to speculate on the short term movements of the price of the underlying financial instruments. You should not enter into forex and/or contracts for difference transactions unless you are able to sustain losses that exceed your deposited funds. It is important for you to understand that in order to realise any value from your open positions, you would have to enter into a corresponding transaction to close your open positions and you may find it difficult or impossible to do so under certain market conditions.</p>

<h2>Execution model and counterparty risk</h2>
<p>Champion-FX.com offers forex and contracts for difference transactions via the hybrid model, i.e., both dealing on own account (dealing desk) and partially hedging client orders with our liquidity providers (no-dealing desk). Client orders are typically hedged when the total transaction volume exceeds a predefined threshold of risk tolerance level. For both execution models, Champion-FX.com acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that you enter into with us, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contracts for difference transaction that you entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction's cash flow.</p>

<h2>Leverage</h2>
<p>Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account.</p>
<p>Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin).</p>

<h2>Relationship between Margin and Leverage</h2>
<p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times your margin (the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be "leveraged" to enter into a Transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always 1. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that we/you establish will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, the lower the leverage you set for your Account, the higher the margin required to be set aside from your account balance (your margin requirement).</p>

<h2>Risk of Stop Order</h2>
<p>The system fills orders on a first-in, first-out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond our control. As a result, you may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in your Stop Order during certain market conditions. The placement of a Stop Order by you, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit your losses to your intended amounts, in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders and there is uncertainty about your possible exit price. In short, a Stop Order is not guaranteed because it cannot always operate irrespective of the market circumstances.</p>
<h2>Regular monitoring of open positions</h2>
<p>Trading forex and contracts for difference carries a high level of risk and Champion-FX.com does not monitor the open positions of your account on your behalf. It is your responsibility to monitor your Open Positions and understand the exposure of your Open Positions whilst ensuring that your exposure is commensurate with your risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, you should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which you ordinarily transact in instead of investing in a contract for difference.</p>
<h2>Risk of slippage</h2>
<p>Whilst we endeavour to open or close the Transaction to which your orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that your order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when you placed your order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to you) or a negative slippage (less favourable to you).</p>

<h2>External forces</h2>
<p>Your forex and contracts for difference transactions with Champion-FX.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument and you will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate, or other volatility of the market to which your financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to you. Forex and contracts for difference trading over the internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk which may result in delays in order execution.</p>

                                <h2>Order Execution Policy</h2>
<p>We have a general duty to conduct our business with you honestly, fairly, and professionally and to act in your best interests when opening and closing Binary Options trades with you.</p>
<p>More specifically, when we enter into a Binary Option trade with you (each, a "Contract"), we have a duty to provide you with 'best execution'. Best execution means that we must take reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for you when executing an order for you. This document provides a summary of our best execution policy.</p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>When we enter into Contracts with you, we will take all reasonable steps to achieve the best possible result for you by executing those Contracts according to our order execution policy, and subject to any specific instructions received from you. Our order execution policy comprises a set of procedures that are designed to obtain the best possible execution result for you, subject to and taking into account: (a) the nature of your Contracts, (b) the priorities you have identified to us in relation to entering into those Contracts, and (c) the practices relating to the market in question, with the aim of producing a result which provides, in our view, the best balance across a range of sometimes conflicting factors. Our policy cannot provide a guarantee, however, that when entering into Contracts with you, the price will always be better than one which is, or might have been available elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Best Execution Factors</h2>
<p>In relation to Contracts that you enter into with us, we act as principal and not as agent on your behalf and we therefore act as the sole execution venue for the execution of your Contracts.</p>
<p>We are required to take a number of factors into account when considering how to give you best execution. We have rated price as the most important followed by: (a) costs; (b) size, (c) liquidity of the underlying market, (d) speed and (e) likelihood of execution and settlement. The main way in which we will ensure that you obtain best execution is by ensuring that in our calculation of our bid/offer prices, we pay due consideration to the market price for the underlying reference product to which your Contract relates. We have access to a number of different data sources in order to ascertain the market price, which is our objective view of the bids and offers available at arm's' length to traders.</p>
<p>In relation to some Contracts, at the time at which you give us an order, there may be no functioning or open market or exchange on which the reference product is traded. In such cases, we set out to determine a fair underlying price based on a number of factors such as price movements on associated markets and other market influences, and information about our clients' own orders.</p>
<h2>Specific Instructions</h2>
<p>Where you give us specific instructions, including for example (a) specifying the price of a Contract with us, or (b) specifying the price at which a Contract is to be closed, then those instructions take precedence over other aspects of our policy.</p>
<h2>No Fiduciary Duty</h2>
<p>Our commitment to provide you with 'best execution' does not mean that we owe you any fiduciary responsibilities over and above the specific regulatory obligations placed upon us, or as may be otherwise contracted between us.</p>
<h2>Monitoring and Reviewing of this Policy</h2>
<p>We will monitor the effectiveness of our order execution arrangements and order execution policy. We will assess from time to time whether the venues relied upon by us in pricing our Contracts on your behalf allow us to achieve best execution on a consistent basis, or whether we need to make changes to our execution arrangements. We will also review our order execution arrangements and order execution policy in respect of material changes, either in respect of one of our chosen pricing venues, or that otherwise affect our ability to continue to achieve best execution. Should there be any material changes to our order execution arrangements or order execution policy, we will notify you.</p>

                                <h2>Order Execution Policy</h2>
<h2>A. Introduction</h2>
<p>The term 'we', 'us', 'our', 'ours', 'the Company', or 'Champion-FX.com' shall denote Champion Group Ltd.</p>
<p>Our Order Execution Policy (the "Policy") sets out the overview and approach of how Champion-FX.com executes orders on behalf of our clients.</p>
<p>The Policy is supplemented by Appendix A which provides further details to our considerations as they are related to differing asset classes. The accompanying Appendix A should be read in conjunction with this Policy.</p>
<h2>B. Scope</h2>
<p>This Policy applies to retail and professional clients of Champion-FX.com dealing in financial products offered by Champion-FX.com.</p>

<h2>C. Definition of Best Execution</h2>
<p>Best execution is the requirement to take all sufficient steps to obtain, when executing orders, the best possible result for you taking into account price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature, or any other consideration relevant (hereinafter referred to as "execution factors") to the execution of the order.</p>

<h2>D. Client Instructions</h2>
<p>When we accept an order from you to open or close a transaction, or any other specific instructions in relation to your order, we will endeavour to follow your instructions as far as reasonably possible, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution in accordance with your instructions. These specific instructions include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>The venue at which your order will be executed;</li>
    <li>The price at which your order will be executed;</li>
    <li>The time at which your order will be executed; and</li>
    <li>The timeframe or duration of the contract as defined by your order execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where a particular venue has been specified in your instructions with respect to the execution of an order, we will not be responsible for the venue selection.</p>
<p>Where a particular time or timeframe has been specified in a client's instructions with respect to the execution of an order, regardless of the price available, we will endeavour to execute the order at the specified time or over the specified timeframe in the best possible manner after taking all sufficient steps. However, we will not be responsible for any consequences related to pricing that resulted from the time or timeframe of the execution.</p>
<p>Aspects of a client order not affected by specific instructions are subject to the application of the Policy. In the absence of specific instructions from our clients, we will exercise our own discretion in determining the factors that are required to be taken into account for the purpose of providing you with best execution, having regard to the execution criteria listed below:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>the characteristics of the client;</li>
    <li>the characteristics of the order;</li>
    <li>the characteristics of financial instruments that are the subject of that order; and</li>
    <li>the characteristics of the execution venues to which that order can be directed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>E. Best Execution Obligation</h2>
<p>Champion-FX.com owes you a duty of best execution when executing orders on your behalf, i.e., when you are placing a legitimate reliance on us to safeguard your interest in relation to the execution of your order.</p>
<p>In executing orders on your behalf, Champion-FX.com takes into consideration the following to achieve the best possible result for you:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>Price &ndash; The price at which the transaction in relation to your order is executed at.</li>
    <li>Costs &ndash; The costs of executing your order comprised predominantly of spread, i.e., the difference between our bid and our offer price.</li>
    <li>Speed &ndash; The speed at which your order can be executed.</li>
    <li>Likelihood of execution and settlement &ndash; The depth of liquidity of the market in which your order is related to.</li>
    <li>Size &ndash; The size of your order determined by the volume (number of lots).</li>
    <li>Any other consideration relevant to the execution of the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The factor listed above are not listed in order of priority. Ordinarily, price will merit a high relative importance in obtaining the best possible result for you. However, the relative importance of the listed factors above may change in accordance with:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>the specific instructions that we receive from you; and</li>
    <li>the market conditions of the financial instruments that your orders are related to, which includes the need for timely execution, availability of price improvement, liquidity of the market, size of your order, and the potential impact on total consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our determination of the relative importance of the execution factors may differ from yours during certain circumstances, acting in your interest in accordance with our obligation of best execution.</p>

<h2>F. Execution Venues</h2>
<p>Champion-FX.com offers forex and contracts for difference via the hybrid model, i.e., both dealing on own account (dealing desk) and partially hedging client orders with our liquidity providers (no-dealing desk).</p>
<p>When we deal on own account (dealing desk), we act as principal and not as an agent on your behalf and we therefore act as the execution venue.</p>
<p>Whilst we act as principal in respect of your orders, we also assess the execution venues that we use and upon which we place significant reliance to provide the best possible result for the execution of your orders. These venues typically consist of third-party investment firms, brokers, and/or liquidity providers.</p>
<p>Champion-FX.com assesses the choice of external execution venues regularly (at least once a year) with the intention of achieving a better result for you based on our best execution obligation.</p>

<h2>G. Order Handling</h2>
<p>All client orders are processed on a first-in, first-out basis without any manual intervention. When executing your order, Champion-FX.com will seek to fill your order transaction as promptly as possible, at the instructed price (or at a better price, if available). Exposure limits are established based on internal governance arrangements and risk management framework which commensurate with the size, nature, complexity, and risk profile of our activities. These exposure limits are used as benchmarks to distinguish orders that are auto-accepted and orders that will be worked in the market with fill level passed on to the client.</p>

<h2>H. Monitoring and Review</h2>
<p>We will monitor the effectiveness of our order execution arrangements and Policy. We will assess from time to time whether the venues relied upon by us in pricing our Contracts on your behalf allow us to achieve best execution on a consistent basis or whether we need to make changes to our execution arrangements. We will also review our order execution arrangements and order execution policy in respect of material changes either in respect of one of our chosen pricing venues or that otherwise affect our ability to continue to achieve best execution. Should there be any material changes to our order execution arrangements or Policy, we will notify you.</p>

<h2>Appendix &ndash; Product Specific Policies</h2>
<h2>A. Spot FX</h2>
<p>For features and trading illustration of Spot FX offered by Champion-FX.com, refer to the Product Disclosure Statement. This policy is an appendix to the overarching Policy and should be read in conjunction with the overarching Policy.</p>
<p>Champion-FX.com provides you best execution by utilising a smart aggregation method when managing incoming orders. The smart aggregation method works by:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>consolidating liquidity from several providers into a single stream of blended feed; and</li>
    <li>intelligently routing incoming orders to different types of execution modes based on configurations and algorithms established using best execution factors.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the intelligent order routing system ensures that the top of the book is always comprised of the best bid and offer rates quoted by the competing liquidity providers. However, during times of market illiquidity, this may change with likelihood of execution being the primary execution factor.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of risk that we are exposed to acting as your counterparty, we largely act in a principal capacity of your trades. As such, the execution venue will usually be Champion-FX.com. However, we may transmit your order to third-party liquidity providers, in which case we will determine the execution venue ourselves on the basis described above.</p>
<p>The execution venues are assessed, on a regular basis, on whether they provide for the best possible result for our clients.</p>

<h2>A. Introduction</h2>
<p>The term 'we', 'us', 'our', 'ours', 'the Company', or 'Champion-FX.com' shall denote Champion Group Ltd.</p>
<p>Our slippage policy (the "Policy") sets out the overview and approach of how Champion-FX.com handles price changes between the time a client first submits an order (your requested price) until the time the order reaches the electronic trading system (your execution price).</p>
<h2>B. Scope</h2>
<p>This Policy applies to retail and professional clients of Champion-FX.com dealing in financial products offered by Champion-FX.com.</p>
<h2>C. Principles of Trade</h2>
<p>All orders initiated by you and accepted by us are based on principles of fair and transparent dealing, and good faith. We will endeavour to execute your transactions by observing high ethical standards and just and equitable principles of trade.</p>
<h2>D. Definition of Slippage</h2>
<p>Price slippage occurs between the time a client first submits an order (your requested price) until the time the order reaches the electronic trading system (your execution price). The difference between the requested price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage.</p>
<p>Slippage occurs during:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
    <li>Extremely high or low market volatility</li>
    <li>Off market hours</li>
    <li>Low market liquidity</li>
    <li>Key news releases</li>
    <li>Rapid market price fluctuation</li>
    <li>Network latency</li>
</ul>
<h2>E. Fair Execution Obligation</h2>
<p>Champion-FX.com owes you a duty of fair execution when executing orders on your behalf. In executing orders on your behalf, Champion-FX.com takes all reasonable steps to avoid conflict of interest by adhering to a non-asymmetrical slippage policy and by ensuring that orders are filled in a symmetrical manner when slippages occur.</p>
<p>When slippages occur, we may immediately requote you the current price and seek your confirmation prior to executing your order at the requoted price. Prices are requoted regardless of the direction the market has moved, i.e., when the market moves against us and when the market moves in our favour.</p>
<p>In certain scenarios, we may utilise our built-in slippage parameters to execute orders when slippage occurs. These built-in slippage parameters permit the execution of the order if the slippage is within the established parameters. The slippage settings are applied uniformly regardless of the direction the market has moved.</p>
<p>We use reasonable endeavours within our control to ensure that all electronic transactions instructed and accepted from you to us, and executed by us are not subject to network latency. As such, slippages only occur based on real market conditions.</p>
<h2>F. Monitoring and Review</h2>
<p>We will monitor the effectiveness of our slippage parameters and slippage policy. We will assess from time to time whether we need to make changes to our slippage parameters. We will also review our slippage parameters and slippage policy in respect of material changes that may otherwise affect our ability to continue to achieve fair execution.</p>
