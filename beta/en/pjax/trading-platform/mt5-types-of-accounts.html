        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm">
                <h4>1. Account currency</h4>
                <div class="separator primary-color"></div>
                <p>Is the currency of the funds accepted in your trading account.</p>
                <h4>2. Leverage</h4>
                <div class="separator primary-color"></div>
                <p>Is the ability to control a large amount of money using a minimal capital from yourself. Where does the rest of the money come from? Your trusted broker provides the rest.</p>
                <p>Let’s say you fork out a capital of USD 50 and we’re offering a leverage of 1:1,000. How much money, or margin, is available to you when you start trading?</p>
                <div class="box bordered">
                    <p class="secondary-color">USD 50 x 1,000 = <strong>USD 50,000 (is the margin available)</strong></p>
                </div>
                <h4>3. Order execution</h4>
                <div class="separator primary-color"></div>
                <p>Typically comes in two varieties: market execution and instant execution. With market execution, you place an order at the broker’s price. You agree on the price in advance. There are no requotes with market execution.</p>
                <p>What about instant execution? In this case, your order is place at the price that’s available at that time. Requotes are possible if the price fluctuates a great deal before the order execution is complete.</p>

                <h4>4. Spread</h4>
                <div class="separator primary-color"></div>
                <p>Is the difference between the buy price and sell price. When you enter into a trade, you are buying an asset that you will be selling at a later time or date for a profit or loss. The difference in price is called a spread. A variable spread means that the spread will remain as it is no matter the market condition. A tight spread and our tightest spread means that the spread may increase depending on market conditions, as it is subject to market volatility caused by news events.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <h4>5. Commission</h4>
                <div class="separator primary-color"></div>
                <p>Refers to the commission fees that we charge for each trade you place with us. ChampionFX currently charges no commission for all accounts.</p>
                <h4>6. Margin call</h4>
                <div class="separator primary-color"></div>
                <p>Refers to the state where the remaining funds in your account is unable to cover the leverage or margin requirement. You can deposit additional funds to prevent a margin call escalating to a stop out level.</p>

                <h4>7. Stop out level</h4>
                <div class="separator primary-color"></div>
                <p>Is the level where your margin ratio has become unsustainable, and we issue a forced closure of pending orders, and any open positions. A stop out level usually results from a high negative balance in your trading account.</p>


                <h4>8. Hedged margin</h4>
                <div class="separator primary-color"></div>
                <p>Refers to the funds required to open and maintain a position on the same asset, but in opposite directions.</p>

                <h4>9. Maximum ticket size</h4>
                <div class="separator primary-color"></div>
                <p>Refers to the maximum volume of lots allowed per trade.</p>
