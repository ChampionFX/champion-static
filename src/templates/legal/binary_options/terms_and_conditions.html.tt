<p>[% l("International currency, stock index, or commodity prices are highly volatile and very difficult to predict. Due to such volatility, plus the bias in the pricing system favouring the website (as described in more detail below), all contracts purchased in our system (whether or not the payout exceeds the premium amount) must be considered as carrying a high degree of risk.") %]</p>

Clients have a duty to report to the Company any such problems, errors, or suspected system inadequacies that they may experience and may not abuse of, or arbitrage such system problems or errors for profit. The Company will endeavour to resolve any such difficulties in the shortest time possible. Any amendments to the contractual terms (including, but not limited to, entry and exit spot) of Manifestly Erroneous contracts shall be reasonable and fair. Monies exchanged between oneself and the Company in connection with Manifestly Erroneous contracts shall be returned to the recipient according to the amendments made to the contractual terms (including, but not limited to, entry and exit spot).

<h2>O. [% l("Trading Rules") %]</h2>

    <li>[% l("Contracts are not usually offered in the last hour of trade of any given market (for foreign exchange markets, the restriction may be extended up to 3 hours).") %]</li>
    <li>[% l("Contracts will not usually be offered when the underlying market is at its intraday high or intraday low.") %]</li>
    <li>[% l("Contracts on certain markets will not be offered during the first 10 minutes of the trading day.") %]</li>
    <li>[% l("During fast markets (i.e. periods of very fast market movements), contracts may be offered at prices more unfavourable than those offered in usual market conditions.") %]</li>
    <li>[% l("Certain limits are imposed as to the acceptable levels for barrier/strike prices of contracts. Typically, the barrier/strike may not be too close nor too far from the current underlying market level.") %]</li>
    <li>[% l("Contracts may not expire on a weekend; therefore the expiry date of a contract may be pushed forward to the following Monday in the event of a contract expiry date falling on a Saturday or a Sunday.") %]</li>
    <li>[% l("Market prices are updated at most once per second. For any given second, the market price will be updated to the first tick, if any, received in that particular second on the company data feed.") %]</li>
    <li>[% l("The Company does not guarantee the ability to sell a contract prior to its expiration time.") %]</li>
</ul>
<h2>P. [% l("Contract Payouts") %]</h2>
<p>[% l("Contract payouts shall be determined by the Company by reference to the daily high/low/close values reported on this website relevant to the underlying index(ices) of the contract(s), or from the interbank trading data received by the Company for Forex quotes or commodities prices as displayed on the website, subject that the Company shall have the right to make corrections to such data in the event of mis-priced or typographically incorrect data. Clients should note that the different markets may close at different times during the day due to local trading hours and time zones.") %]</p>
<p>[% l("In the case of single stock and stock index prices, the final closing price as reported by the relevant official exchange shall apply for all settlements (this final settlement price may, at times, be reported by the relevant exchange 30-90 minutes after the official closing time of the market, and may differ from the latest tick price that occurred at the closing time).") %]</p>
<p>[% l("For Forex quotes, the closing times are defined by the Company as shown in the Trading Times section of the website. In the event of any dispute regarding market or settlement values, the decision of the Company shall be final and binding. Clients should note that certain markets (such as stocks and stock indices) are not open throughout the day and that trading may not be available when the markets are closed.") %]</p>
<p>[% l("The calculation of the price to be paid (or the payout to be received) for financial contracts on this site at the time the financial contract is purchased or sold will be based on the Company's best estimate of market price movements and the expected level of interest rates, implied volatilities and other market conditions during the life of the financial contract, and is based on complex mathematics. The calculation will include a bias in favour of the Company. The financial contract prices (or the payout amounts) offered to Clients speculating on market or index prices may differ substantially from prices available in the primary markets where stock indices or commodities or contracts thereupon are traded, due to the bias favouring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above.") %]</p>
<p>[% l("The charting data made available to Clients by the Company is indicative only and may, at times, differ from the real market values. The Company's decision as to the calculation of a financial contract price will be final and binding. The Company allows the option to sell contracts before expiry time of some contracts but will not be obliged to do so and can suspend this option depending on the current market conditions. Contracts may be amended when the underlying asset value is adjusted by corporate actions during the contract period.") %]</p>
<p>[% l("Should a disruption occur in the data feeds which cannot be readily rectified by the Company, the Company reserves the right to refund the contract purchase.") %]</p>
<h2>Q. [% l("Trading Limits") %]</h2>

<p>[% l("If you would like to file a complaint with regards to our service, kindly contact us and provide any relevant details relating to your complaint.

We will usually provide a final response within 1-2 weeks (and at most within 2 months) from receipt of all relevant details.") %]</p>
<p>[% l("If your complaint relates to an outcome of a trade or a transaction, and remains unresolved, it will turn into a dispute. Should you be unsatisfied with our response, you can choose to escalate your complaint to the regulator or to an alternative dispute resolution entity.") %]</p>
<p>[% l("Clients registered with Champion Group Ltd can raise their unresolved disputes with management by submitting an email to complaints@champion-fx.com.") %]</p>
<h2>S. [% l("Conflicts Policy") %]</h2>
<p>[% l("We provide here a summary of the policy we maintain in order to manage conflicts of interest in respect of the duties we owe to our Clients.") %]</p>
<ol>
    <li>[% l("General") %]
        <p>[% l("It is understood that Champion Group Ltd, as a counterparty, has an interest, relationship, or arrangement that is material in relation to any trade effected on behalf of you, and it is agreed that any company so interested shall be entitled to retain any benefit or profit received, and shall not be liable to account therefore to you by reason only of such conflict.") %]</p>
        <p>[% l("We aim to establish, maintain, and operate effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all reasonable steps to prevent conflicts of interest from constituting or giving rise to a material risk of damage to the interests of our Clients.") %]</p>
        <p>[% l("We have in place adequate internal procedures to ensure that you are in all cases treated fairly and that the risk of damage to Client interests will be mitigated.") %]</p>
    </li>
    <li>[% l("Our Policy") %]
        <p>[% l("We aim to keep a record of the kinds of activity we carry on in which a material conflict could arise or has arisen. We also maintain procedures to manage actual or potential conflicts. This includes procedures to maintain appropriate independence between members of our staff who are involved in potentially conflicting activities, for example, through the operation of information barriers, physical separation of staff, the segregation of duties and responsibilities and maintenance of a policy of independence which requires our staff, when providing services to a Client, to act in the best interests of the Client and to disregard any conflicts of interest; and, in some circumstances declining to act for a Client or potential Client.") %]</p>
    </li>
    <li>[% l("Disclosure: general") %]
        <p>[% l("Where our arrangements to manage conflicts are not or cannot be sufficient to be reasonably confident that risks of damage to a Client's interest will be prevented, we aim to disclose the general nature or sources of conflicts. This is aimed at allowing the Client the opportunity to consider whether to ask for more information by sending an email to compliance@champion-fx.com, or to continue with the service; we do not aim to provide detailed, highly specific, or comprehensive information.") %]</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>T. [% l("Data Feed") %]</h2>
<p>[% l("Information about the data feeds used by the Company, and how the data is processed before being fed into the system.") %]</p>
<ol>
    <li>[% l("Filtering Stray Ticks") %]
        <p>[% l("Depending on the quality of the data feeds received from our feed providers, our servers might apply a tick filtering algorithm. The purpose of this filtering algorithm is to strip the feed of stray ticks. Stray ticks are ticks that manifestly fall outside of the current trading range of the market; such ticks are often due to communication delays with the exchanges or banks that provide quotes, human error, or database problems at any point between the originator of the quote and our servers.") %]</p>
        <p>[% l("The filtering algorithm may, for example, be similar to the \"Bollinger Bands\" volatility system –– i.e., short-term volatility bands are determined around the present market value, and ticks that are manifestly outside of such bands are removed.") %]</p>
    </li>
    <li>[% l("Smoothing out random noise") %]
        <p>[% l("Depending on the quality of the feeds received from our feed providers, our servers might also apply a very short-term smoothing algorithm to the data feed. This smoothing algorithm removes a little of the \"random noise\" surrounding the data feed, and ensures that clients who buy path- dependent contracts (such as the one-touch or barrier-range contracts) will not have their contracts knocked-in or knocked-out by random short-term market noise that does not reflect the true market price.") %]</p>
    </li>
    <li>[% l("Differences with other data feeds") %]
        <p>[% l("Our data feed may at times differ slightly from other data feeds found on the internet (who may themselves differ between each other). Reasons for differences in feed providers include:") %]</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>[% l("For Forex: The Forex market is an OTC (over- the- counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no 'official' price source for Forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different subset of international banks. Accordingly, prices may differ between providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.") %]</li>
            <li>[% l("The smoothing and filtering algorithms described above.") %]</li>
            <li>[% l("Market-closing times: Please refer to the Trading Times page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example, some websites choose 4 o'clock NY time, or 5 o'clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low, and closing prices displayed on our website may differ to those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.") %]</li>
            <li>[% l("Use of bid/ask prices: when the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. Our system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, our website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.") %]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>[% l("Our data feed is designed to be one of the best and most robust available for a trading environment.") %]</p>
    </li>
    <li>[% l("Weekend quotes") %]
        <p>[% l("Please note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of contract settlement. During weekends, the Forex markets may occasionally generate prices. However, these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push prices up or down). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is the Company’s policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values.") %]</p>
