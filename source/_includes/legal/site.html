<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
	<p><i>Last modified 2016-12-05.</i></p>
	<p>It is the responsibility of each Client to read and understand this legal notice and the terms and conditions pursuant to which an acquisition of financial contracts via this site is governed.</p>
<h2>A. Interpretation</h2>
	<p>The term "the Company" shall denote Champion Group Ltd., Govant Building, Port Vila, P.O. Box 1276, Vanuatu, Republic of Vanuatu. These Terms and Conditions may be supplemented from time to time by Supplementary Terms and Conditions applicable to a particular Company or products.</p>
<h2>B. Introduction</h2>
	<p>The financial trading services contained within this site are only suitable for Clients who are able to bear the loss of all the money they invest and who understand and have experience of the risks involved in the acquisition of financial contracts.</p>
	<p>International currency, stock index, or commodity prices are highly volatile and very difficult to predict. Due to such volatility, plus the bias in the pricing system favouring the website (as described in more detail below), no financial contract purchased in our system (whether or not the payout exceeds the premium amount) can be considered a safe contract.</p>
	<p>The maximum loss that may be incurred by any Client is the amount of money paid by oneself to the Company.</p>
	<p>The Company reserves the right in its sole discretion to refuse and/or cancel services, charge deposit, and/or withdrawal fees to anyone for any reasons including, but not limited to:</p>
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>any instance where the Company believes that person's activities at this site may be illegal in that person's country or state;</li>
		<li>any instance where the Company may be approached or contacted by legal authorities or regulators from that person's country or state;</li>
		<li>any instance where the Company may suffer any pecuniary, fiscal or regulatory disadvantage by virtue of that person's activities at this site;</li>
		<li>any restriction to its Clients from purchasing any contracts during certain hours.</li>
	</ul>
